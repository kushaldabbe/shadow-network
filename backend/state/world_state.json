The attacks, which disrupted power grids and financial systems, have been attributed to a state-sponsored hacking group with known ties to Russian intelligence. NATO has convened an emergency session to assess the situation, with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg describing the attacks as 'a dangerous escalation that crosses red lines.' Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials have publicly accused Moscow of orchestrating the campaign, though the Kremlin has denied involvement. Cybersecurity firms report the malware used bears striking similarities to tools deployed in previous attacks linked to the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency.",
